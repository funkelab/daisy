    "As mentioned earlier, we highly recommend using a zarr/n5 backend for your volume. Daisy is designed such that no data is transmitted between the worker and the scheduler, including the output of the processing. That means that each worker is responsible for saving the results in the given block write_roi. With a zarr backend, each worker can write to a specific region of the zarr in parallel, assuming that the chunk size is a divisor of and aligned with the write_roi. The zarr dataset must exist before you start scheduling though - we recommend using [`funlib.persistence.prepare_ds`](https://github.com/funkelab/funlib.persistence/blob/f5310dddb346585a28f3cb44f577f77d4f5da07c/funlib/persistence/arrays/datasets.py#L423) function to prepare the dataset.

First, you see the progress bar, which also reports the number of blocks at each state, including failed blocks. Any worker error messages are also logged to the scheduler log, although not the full traceback. Upon completion, daisy provides an error summary, which informs you of the final status of all the blocks, and points you to the full output and error logs for each worker, which can be found in `daisy_logs/<task_name>`. The worker error log will contain the full traceback for debugging the exact source of an error."
