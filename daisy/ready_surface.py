class ReadySurface:
    """
    The ready surface is a datastructure to keep track of the nodes in a
    dependency graph that are ready to be scheduled. Nodes can be marked as
    success or failure. All nodes downstream of a failure are considered a
    failure.
    The purpose is to minimize the in-memory storage of blocks.

    nodes can have 3 states:
    1: SURFACE
    2: BOUNDARY
    3: OTHER

    A node is a SURFACE node iff
        1) it has been marked as successfully completed
        2) it has downstream dependencies marked as OTHER
    A node is a BOUNDARY node iff
        1) it has been marked as failed
        2) It has upstream dependencies marked as SURFACE
